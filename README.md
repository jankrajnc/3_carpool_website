#### Description:
  This is a carpool sharing website meant for people who often drive together to the same destination. The users create a common group that logs the information of their drives. The website offers an overview of all the drives as well as gives suggestions on who the next driver should be. It's also possible to set users as guests/inactive and they will be greyed out and no longer applicable for the next driver suggestions.
